                    id="inp_about">CASPAM has established a high reputation for its exceptional standards in teaching, research and holistic development. Highly qualified faculty with sound professional and moral values, open, inclusive, competitive, encouraging, supportive and conducive teaching and learning environment, innovative, interactive and technology-based methods of teaching leading to outcome based education, state of the art infrastructure, students councils for developing leadership qualities and soft skills, activities promoting academia-industry linkages, modern and diverse areas of research and strong alumni network have made CASPAM an exceptionally attractive place imparting undergraduate and graduate studies for highly motivated, careeroriented and focused students. CASPAM believes in and endeavors for holistic development of its students and making them creative, innovative and capable of conducting cutting-edge research so that they may effectively play their role in transforming the industry, society and humanity so as to make this world peaceful and comfortable to live in. At CASPAM, we recognize the growing significance of the role of Mathematics, in general, in the present-day world and that of business, industrial, financial and computational Mathematics in particular and its integration with the artificial intelligence (AI), data science, informatics, information technologies, and machine learning for meeting the challenges of industrial revolutions 4.0 and 5.0 and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). We offer BS, MS/MPhil and PhD in Mathematics together with these modern areas of knowledge and skills so that our graduates could embark on an exciting journey of exploration, discovery, intellectual growth and personal development, and pursue a career path of their own interest out of the diverse career paths available at CASPAM.

Our study programs focus on critical thinking, applying fundamental concepts, analyzing reallife problems, idea generation, model development, algorithm writing, and solution understanding. Mathematics, alongside tables and graphs, aids in modeling and comprehending problems from various fields. Students not only gain terminology for grasping concepts in science, technology, engineering, business, economics, finance, decision making, and data mining but also learn critical and analytical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and concept generalization. By staying up-to-date with the latest developments in Mathematics, our programs ensure that students are wellprepared to tackle real-world challenges and contribute to the advancement of the discipline. This makes them capable of finding roles such as data scientists, actuaries, business and financial analysts, industrial researchers and problem-solvers in the areas of design, analysis, optimization and automation.</textarea>
